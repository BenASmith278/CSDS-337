% Problem 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}{1 - 15 points}
Suppose that we have a production $A \rightarrow BCD$. Each of  the four nonterminals $A$ , $B$, $C$, and $D$ have two attributes: $s$ is a synthesized  attribute, and $i$ is an inherited attribute. For each of the sets of rules below,  tell whether (i) the rules are consistent with an S-attributed definition (ii) the  rules are consistent with an L-attributed definition, and (iii) whether the rules  are consistent with any evaluation order at all?  

\begin{enumerate}[a]
    \item $A.s = B.i + C.s.$  
    \item $A.s = B.i + C.s$ and $D.i = A.i + B.s.$  
    \item $A.s = B.s + D.s.$
    \item $A.s = D.i, \quad B.i = A.s + C.s, \quad C.i = B.s$, and $D.i = B.i + C.i.$ 
\end{enumerate}
    
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}

\begin{enumerate}[a]
    \item The rule is S-attributed. The rule is also L-attributed. The rule can be evaluated with a depth-first order.
    \item The rules are not S-attributed because $D.i$ is not in the head of the production and thus $D.i = A.i + B.s$ is an inherited attribute. The rules are L-attributed because there are no cyclic dependencies in the inherited attributes of $A$. The rules are consistent with a depth-first evaluation order.
    \item The rule is S-attributed and L-attributed. The rule is consistent with a depth-first evaluation order.
    \item The rules are not S-attributed. The rules are not L-attributed either because the rules $B.i = A.s + C.s$ and $C.i = B.s$ form a cyclic dependency. The rules are not consistent with any evaluation order because no acyclic dependency graph can be created for some inputs.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}{4 - 20 points}
A real array $A [i; j; k]$ has index $i$ ranging from 1 to 4, $j$  ranging from 0 to 4, and $k$ ranging from 5 to 10. Reals take 8 bytes each. If A  is stored row-major, starting at byte 0, find the location of:  

\begin{enumerate}[a]
    \item $A [3; 4 ; 5]$
    \item $A [1; 2 ; 7]$
    \item $A [4; 3 ; 9].$
\end{enumerate} 
Repeat the above if A is stored in column-major order.

\end{problem}

\begin{solution}

\noindent Row-major:
\begin{enumerate}[a]
    \item A row takes 5 * 4 * 8 = 160 bytes of space. The $i=3$ row starts at 320. Add 5 * 3 * 8 = 120 to get to the $j=4$ column in the row. Add 0 * 8 = 0 to get to the $k=5$ index in the column. The location of $A[3;4;5]$ is at 440 bytes.
    \item 40 + 16 = 56 bytes.
    \item 480 + 80 + 72 = 632 bytes.
